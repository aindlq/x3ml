The right portion is missing but the front carries a two-line Sabaean inscription referring to a dedication to Almaqah, with a large monogram at the left. The two small holes above and below the monogram were to secure the plaque onto a wall. Unusually, there are no guide lines traced on the front to help the craftsman design the letters.
The frequency with which these plaques were used in antiquity is not only demonstrated by the large number which survive, but also by the attachment holes and iron nails found in situ on the facades and pillars of public buildings such as the Awwam temple at Marib. Very few have been found in archaeological contexts and those reportedly found at Amran are believed to date between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, although palaeographic dating suggests a date as early as the 5th century BC for a similar example dedicated to Almaqah and excavated near the peristyle hall of the Awwam Temple at Marib. These inscriptions were made not by simply casting in an incised mould but instead made use of the so-called “lost wax technique”, whereby the individual letters were formed by adding, trimming and punching where necessary separate threads of wax between incised lines on the face of a thick wax plaque which was then covered in several layers of clay, baked with molten bronze poured in through the side to replace the wax, before cracking off the clay shell and polishing the metal. The incurved edges reflect shrinking of the wax original. The essentially rectangular shape with the flat raised frame around the recessed page indicates that they were influenced by the shape of hinged wooden or ivory writing-boards where the inscriptions were incised into wax-filled pages, the raised borders of which prevented the contents from smudging when the pages were folded together. This form of writing-board was widely used throughout the Near East from at least the 14th century: the earliest example to survive is an ivory-hinged example found on the site of a shipwreck at Ulu Burun off south-west Turkey. Clay sealings of the same period which were excavated at the Hittite capital of Hattusha are believed to have originally been attached to similar wooden writing-boards, and these boards are illustrated on 8th century Late Assyrian reliefs as well as being described in contemporary texts as being used alongside parchment scrolls and clay tablets. Mesopotamian texts refer to the beeswax on these boards being coloured yellow with orpiment, which appears to have been a practical device of rendering the incised wax inscription easier to read in the sun; equivalent Roman scribes who continued to use writing-boards coloured the wax with crushed charcoal.
	This bronze plaque was among a collection of 26 inscriptions presented to the Museum in 1862 by Colonel (later Brigadier-General) William Marcus Coghlan (1803-1885), who was then serving as the East India Company Political Resident and Commandant in Aden. However, as early as about 1870, a Jew in Sanaa appears to have been making fake bronze inscriptions, but these are technically easily distinguishable from the originals as they were cast in sand rather than clay (and therefore have a rougher finish), the lines are separated by raised lines (as on the stone inscriptions), the letters are not individually modelled, and the inscriptions themselves do not make sense. It is indicative that although the decipherment of the South Arabian script was still in its very infancy, questions were raised over the authenticity of these other plaques in correspondence between Samuel Birch (1813-1885), then newly appointed Keeper in the Museum’s former Department of Oriental Antiquities, and Captain W.F. Prideaux (1840-1914) and Reverend Charles Kirk, the East India Company chaplain in Aden.""",

Barraud & Lunds

GOLD CASED LEVER WATCH 
LONDON, 1909

SIGNED: 'Barraud & Lunds, 14 Bishopsgate Within, LONDON. No. 3/4702' (on the movement)

In 1909 the Pelican, a supply ship owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, set sail from London bound for Labrador and Quebec in order to establish a new trading post at Wolstenholme at Eric Cove on the northwest point of the Ungava Peninsula. An account of the voyage and captivating photographs of the Inuit make up part of the personal diary and photo album of an officer on board the ship. Following the British Museum's acquisition of the journal and album, the account and photographs were published by Jonathan King in 'Imaging the Arctic'. The diary and album are thought to be those of either C.M. Cato, an officer on board the Pelican, or, perhaps more likely, the ship's commander, Captain Arthur Smith.
In 2000 the Museum purchased a gold watch that had been presented to Smith in recognition of his actions during difficulties encountered on the return voyage from the Arctic in the autumn of 1909. As Smith or Cato recorded on 8 August ofthat year, \"our propellor got caught & had every blade but one stripped off, so we had to finish our journey with one blade\". King further explains that: \"the Pelican also lost its rudder on 24 August and a replacement was smashed on 26 September. The voyage was further complicated by the need to rescue the Paradox, a steam ketch from Ipswich, with a crew of walrus hunters, which had been badly nipped by the ice and was in a sinking condition.\"
The gold cased lever watch, given to Captain Smith by the underwriters rather than the Hudson's Bay Company itself, is signed on the movement 'Barraud & Lunds, 14 Bishopsgate Within LONDON No. 3/4702'.The standard white enamel dial has the hours I-XII and a sunk subsidiary seconds dial below the centre. The time is shown by blued-steel spade-pattern hands and the maker's name and serial number are inscribed in the upper half. On the underside of the dial are the letters 'O L', fired into it in blue. The 18-carat-gold case is hallmarked 1909 and bears the maker's mark - 'JW' in an oval cameo - of Joseph Walton & Company, which was trading in Upper Charles Street, Clerkenwell, when this case was made. Joseph Walton was born in Coventry around 1834. Following the death of his father he was sent to London to be looked after by his guardian, James Thickbroom, a flourishing Clerkenwell watch-case maker. From his guardian Walton learned the art of watch-case making, and later took over Thickbroom's business.
The insurers clearly did not feel the need to splash out on a fully jewelled free-sprung keyless fusee watch. However, it has a reasonable quality ¾-plate movement with gilt-brass plates and ringed pillars. There is a raised area on the back plate to provide space for a large going barrel, which drives a four-wheel gear train, and there are jewelled bearings for the fourth wheel, escape wheel and balance, the last two with end-stones. The ratchet-tooth lever escapement has jewelled pallet stones and is controlled by a free-sprung, split bimetallic balance with gold timing and compensation screws, and the balance spring has a terminal curve. The dial side of the front plate is punched with the serial number of the watch, along with the numbers '140 2' and the initials 'JP', showing it to be an ébauche supplied by Joseph Preston (see registration 1958,1201.1459). The watch is pendant-wound with rocking-bar hand-setting, operated by a push-piece in the case band at 1 o'clock.
In order to record the underwriters' gratitude, the watch is inscribed to Captain Smith on the inner case dome:

\"Presented to Captain Arthur C. Smith by the Underwriters in recognition of the very exceptional seamanship displayed by him on board The Pelican(s) During his Autumn voyage from Hudson's Bay 1909\"

The engraved monogram 'ACS' on the outside of the case back gives an additional indication of the owner. The watch is still contained in its original, now rather worn, red leather-covered wooden box, with silk lining and the gold embossed inscription 'BARRAUD & LUNDS, 14 Bishopsgate St. LONDON' around and within a gold embossed garter.
The underwriters must have felt highly indebted to Smith. His ability as a seaman enabled him to bring the Pelican safely to port with no rudder and a seriously damaged propeller, which must have almost shaken the ship to pieces as it rotated completely out of balance. His skill and bravery not only brought the ship home in one piece, but also saved its crew and cargo from the perils of the freezing Arctic seas.""";

    <http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/object/PDB7385> bmo:PX_curatorial_comment """Text from Ian Jenkins and Kim Sloan, 'Vases and Volcanoes: Sir William Hamilton and his Collection', BM 1996, cat.45:

From April until September 1778 Sir William Hamilton paid 'John Smith of Rome' a total of £100 on behalf of the Earl of Warwick for Smith's maintenance and for drawings he had in hand for the Earl (British Library, Add. MS 40714, ff. 160, 163, 169, 178). It was not the only occasion Hamilton was asked to provide this service for artists working for Lord Warwick: in the 1790s, he found himself waiting years for the repayment of £500 he had paid on Warwick's behalf to George Wallis (1993,1211.6).
Smith stayed in Naples until July the following year, sharing lodgings with Thomas Jones in December and January, before the latter returned to Rome. Smith and Jones and some of the best eighteenth-century British watercolourists - William Pars, Francis Towne and John Robert Cozens - all worked in the Naples area over the next two years. They all met Hamilton, even making views of and from his villas, but, as noted in the entries on John Robert Cozens's watercolours (Jenkins & Sloan 1996, cat. 20-21), Sir William Hamilton did not list watercolours by any of them in his manuscript list of paintings, nor do they appear in the sale catalogues. In October and November 1774 Joseph Wright of Derby had also visited Naples and met Hamilton, returning to Rome with views of Vesuvius in eruption, 'the most wonderful sight in nature', which he turned into some of his most spectacular paintings  (Fraser, pp.11-12). Hamilton does not appear to have commissioned any views of Vesuvius from Wright, but this is probably because he already owned several by Volaire, Vernet and Hackert and he was currently bearing the cost of a large group of bodycolour paintings of the Campi Phlegraei by Fabris. 
John 'Warwick' Smith's views of the area around Naples included the present watercolour, a previously unrecorded view of the Villa Emma, and a view of Naples from Sir William Hamilton's villa at Portici (watercolour versions in Birmingham City Art Gallery and private collection, London). They were published with an accompanying text between 1792 and 1798 as 'Select Views in Italy' (pls 56, 58, 60). In print form they are particularly reminiscent in composition and style of Fabris's views in the Campi Phlegraei. The Earl of Warwick, obviously inspired by the plates in this magnificent publication, commissioned these views shortly after its appearance in 1776. Smith's later, less expensive collection of topographical prints found a ready market and J. M. W. Turner copied every plate in a sketchbook when he was preparing for his own trip to Italy in 1819.
The text in Smith's 'Select Views in Italy' which accompanied the engraving of this watercolour (pl. 60) gives a graphic description  of the  difficulties  of ascending  the volcano, as well as explaining the shape, size and colour of the crater at the top: 

'The ascent up that part of the mountain called the 'Cone of Vesuvius' is extremely fatiguing and laborious; it can only be accomplished on foot, and with the assistance of a guide, who fastens a girdle around his body, by means of which the adventurer is helped forwards; the difficulty arises from this part of the mountain being exceeding steep, and entirely covered with loose cinders and ashes, so that on ascending every step sinks to the knee, and generally one half is lost by sliding backwards ... The top of the mountain which is here represented was about a quarter of a mile in diameter, and was broken and irregular on the surface; in many places it was cracked; and rent in large fissures, through which issued small volumes of sulphurous vapours and smoke. Near the middle there was another small mountain in the form of a sugar-loaf, in height about 50 yards, & wholly composed of ashes and small cinders, intermixed with large cakes of sulphur of many different hues, of orange, red, yellow, etc. On the top of the small cone is the crater or opening of the mountain. Its form is circular about 100 yards in diameter, perpendicular on its sides and about 100 yards in depth. The bottom was entirely covered with cinders that seemed to be cemented into one cake by heat; at intervals this covering heaved up, and as the rarefied air underneath got vent, it all at once, or by degrees subsided\".""";

目立たない大きさの画面ながら、年老いた旅人の忘我の表情が目を引く。彼は、旅の僧西行（1118－80）と考えられてきた。ただし、岡の真中に神社の鳥居があるという遠景がどこのものかは明らかでない。旅人のぼろぼろの黒衣は豊かな漆黒で歯切れよく仕上げられ、淡彩の遠景と対照的であり、この二要素が中央軸の左右で完璧に調和している。

道行く遊女の頭だけが扇面の一角に覗くという、機知に富み意表を突く構図である。頭は従者が翳す大傘に半ば隠され、傘に雪が積もった形が扇面の曲線に呼応している。一九による狂歌は、雪に埋もれた彼女の苦闘を借金苦になぞらえるもので、抵当が少なく危険のみ大きい貸しを例えた「百貫のかたにに笠一蓋」という諺が、吉原入口の編笠茶屋との地口となっている。身を隠したい客は、この茶屋で深い編笠をかぶることができたのである。

十返舎一九（1765－1831）は、享和2年（1802）以降ほぼ生涯にわたって出版された「道中膝栗毛」及びその続編でよく知られた滑稽本作家で、素人画家でもあった。扇面の制作時期は、北馬の落款の字体からおそらく文化年間、彼の比較的初期と考えられる。

勅撰和歌集『古今和歌集』（10世紀初頭成立）の紀貫之による仮名序に、「花になく鶯、水にすむ蛙の声を聞けば、生きとし生けるもの、いずれか歌をよまざりける」とある。六樹園の生意気な和歌賛は、これとは別の「騒音」が聞こえるというもの。

一方北渓は、優しく六歌仙を描いている。左から在原業平、文屋康秀、喜撰法師、大伴黒主、小野小町、僧正遍昭が我々から離れて座り、頭を寄せあって和歌について談義している。六歌仙は古今集序文で名付けられたものであるが、頭を打ち合うという賛の言い回しは、貫之の各歌仙評が決して寛大ではなかったことを連想させる。

度重なる使用により画面は荒れて汚れているが、基本的構図は判別できる。縁に出た芸者が笄をもてあそびつつ月下の隅田川を眺めている。遠くに見えるのは両国橋であろう。大田南畝（1749－1823）が記す狂歌によれば、彼女は宴席を抜け出し、酔心地を鎮めるため風を入れにきたところである。川のほとりでの夕涼みは、夏扇の格好の題材であった。ここでは、弧を描く両国橋が扇紙の形によく呼応している。

この絵の主題には、ヘンリー•ジョリィが簡潔な説明を与えている（Henry Joly ‘Legend in Japanese Art’, London, John Lane, 1908, P.25）。すなわち、象を撫でる盲人は一般的な画題で、かつてインドから象が日本にもたらされた時、触りにきた盲人たちが、牙や鼻、足など触る場所に応じて刀、蛇、木の幹などを想像し、この怪物がいかなる生き物なのか話がまとまらなかったという。ここから、部分だけで判断せず全体を見よという教訓が引き出された。

巨大な象が片隅に寄せられ扇の縁で半ば切りとられるのに対し、小さな盲人は構図の中央に置き忘れられたかのようで、彼の混乱ぶりが巧みに現わされている。墨と淡彩による伝統的な狩野派様式と、象を描く遠近法やその皮膚の造型感覚などの西洋から新たに渡来した要素が融合し、永濯のような明治初期に作画した画家が支配されていた雑多な影響を映し出している。

In this witty and eccentric composition just the head of a parading courtesan is shown in one corner of the fan, all but hidden by the large snow-covered umbrella held by a servant over her head, the shape of the umbrella echoing the curve of the fan paper. The 'kyoka' poem by Ikku likens her struggle through the snow to being weighed down by debt:

The proverb 'Hyakkan no kata ni kasa ikkan' ('Only a hat as surety for 100 'kan' (1 'kan' was a string of 1,000 copper coins)), referring to a loan in which the risk is great for only a paltry reward, is punned with 'amigasa chaya' ('basket-hat teashop'), the establishments at the entrance to Yoshiwara where patrons who wished to enter the quarter incognito could cover their heads with a deep woven basket-hat.

Juppensha Ikku (1765-1831) was an author of comic novels and amateur painter best known for 'Dochu hizakurige' ('Shanks's Mare') and its various sequels, published from 1802 onwards for most of the rest of his life. The form of Hokuba's signature suggests a relatively early date for the fan in that painter's career, probably during the Bunka era (1804-18).

A ferry boat crosses the Sumida River in countryside on the northern fringes of Edo, with a view of Mt Tsukuba in the distance. The 'kyoka' poem above by one Reido expresses the admiration of passengers for the fine view, and plays on the phrase 'watari ni fune' which means both 'a boat for crossing' and a 'stroke of luck' (in a more proverbial sense):

From his earliest landscape prints of the 1830s Hiroshige designed dozens of series celebrating well-known beauty spots in the city of Edo, culminating in the great late series 'Meisho Edo hyakkei' ('One Hundred Famous Places in Edo') of 1856-8. The form of Hiroshige's signature changed little during his later career, and ascertaining the identity and dates of 'Reido' would permit a more exact dating of the painting.

It has been suggested that the aged traveller, whose rapt expression commands our attention despite the modest size of the painting, may be the itinerant monk-poet Saigyo (1118-80). The distant landscape with a shrine gateway amid hills has not, however, been identified. His tattered black monk's robes are crisply executed in deep, rich black, contrasting with the pale wash landscape - the two elements once again perfectly balanced about the central axis. Hokusai uses a miniature version of his stylised picture seal showing Mt Fuji above clouds, and it seems to have been an occasional practice for smaller versions of an artist's well-known seals to be cut especially for fans and small paintings.

The poet Ki no Tsurayuki's preface to the 'Kokin waka shu' Imperial anthology of the early tenth century begins with the immortal lines about warblers chirping and frogs croaking: '. . . every living creature has its song' ('iki to shi ikeru mono izure ka uta o yomazarikeri'). Rokujuen's cheeky poem suggests that there were other 'noises' to be heard:

Hokuba's genial painting shows the Six Immortals of Poetry ('Rokkasen'): from left to right, Ariwara no Narihira, Funya no Yasuhide, Kisen Hoshi, Otomo no Kuronushi, Ono no Komachi, Sojo Henjo, sitting facing away from us with their heads together in a poetic huddle. The Six Immortals were first so named in the 'Kokinshu' preface, but the reference to heads knocking together may reflect the fact that Tsurayuki was less than generous in his criticisms of each.

Rokujuen (Ishikawa Masamochi, 1753-1830) was one of the leading 'kyoka' poets of his generation, noted for his wide-ranging scholarship in both Japanese and Chinese matters. Here the inscription was written by a stand-in who has imitated well the mannerisms of his calligraphy, one Baita, who is probably Rokujuen's pupil Baitaro.

The painting by Hokuba in quick, fluid ink and colour shows a parading courtesan seen from behind with her young 'kamuro' attendant facing back towards us. A cuckoo sings out as it flies across the top right-hand corner of the fan, suggesting that the season is midsummer.

The main part of the fan, however, is given over to an inscription by the courtesan Somenosuke, the name used by successive generations of high-ranking women in the prestigious Matsubaya house of pleasure in Yoshiwara. High-ranking courtesans were expected to perfect a witty turn of phrase and have elegant flowing handwriting, both of which Somenosuke demonstrates in this inscription. Such a fan would be highly prized by a man of fashion who wished to demonstrate to the world that he was intimate with so grand a lady. The opening preamble containing poignant reflections upon the uncertain life of a prostitute is then deflated by the comic 'senryu' poem which follows, in which the word 'matsuri' in the proverbial phrase 'ato no matsuri' ('the festival that follows') has the secondary meaning of sexual intercourse: 

If in this world there were no partings at dawn, it would not be so hard to bear. No matter how uncertain this life of a prostitute . . .

Katsushika Hokuga was one of the many - almost 200, according to Nagata Seiji ('Kobijutsu', 82-4 (1987)) - minor pupils and later followers of Hokusai, active in the first half of the nineteenth century. A directory published in Edo in 1842 gives his family name as Yamadera Myonosuke, 'na' Nobuyuki, 'go' Karyosai, and says that he lived in Ushigome Takubo. He is thought to have first studied with the Ukiyo-e artist Tomikawa Fusanobu, adopting the name Ginsetsu II. His use of the 'go' Karyosai is said to date from c. 1824. He should not be confused with the other, more famous pupil of Hokusai called Hokuga (written, with the 'ga' character meaning 'goose'), who later used the name Hotei Gosei and was a prolific painter of beautiful women in a highly individual, mannered style.

Though rubbed and soiled from heavy use, the basic composition of this fan painting can, nevertheless, be made out: a geisha seated on a balcony toys with a hairpin as she looks out over the moonlit Sumida River (with probably Ryogoku Bridge in the distance). The 'kyoka' poem inscribed by Ota Nampo (1749-1823) suggests that she has left a drinking party to come and take the air and settle confused, wine-fuelled emotions:

Sobering up,
Her feelings become clear
On the moonlit balcony,
As the wind flutters
Her thin summer robe. 

Scenes of 'taking the cool evening air' ('yu-suzumi') near the river were popular and appropriate subjects for summer fans. Here the curve of Ryogoku Bridge effectively echoes the shape of the paper.

Henry Joly ('Legend in Japanese Art', London, John Lane, 1908, p. 25) gives a concise explanation of the subject of this painting: 

Blind men feeling an elephant is a common subject, and there is a story that once an Indian elephant having been brought to Japan, a party of blind people went to feel it, and could not agree in their opinions of the nature of the monster, finding it like a dagger, a snake, the trunk of a tree as they touched the tusks, the trunk or the legs of the animal. And a moral is deduced therefrom, not to judge of anything on the impression caused by the parts only, instead of the whole.

The placing of the tiny blind man as if he were lost in the centre of the composition cleverly suggests his disorientation, with the massive elephant pushed over to one side and half cut off by the edge of the fan paper. The combination of traditional Kano-style ink and wash painting techniques with newer Western-derived elements, such as the foreshortened stance of the beast and the sense of modelling of his leathery skin, reflects the mixed influences to which painters such as Eitaku working in the early Meiji era were subject.

A 'hossu' is a ceremonial fly whisk used by Zen priests and, more particularly in the context of this painting, is an attribute of Daruma (Bodhidharma), founder of the Zen sect. 'Daruma' was a slang word for 'prostitute' in the Edo period (no. 93), which might explain the humorous mixing of the sacred and profane worlds in the inscription on this fan, phrased as if it were a Zen 'koan' (philosophical riddle):

This is undoubtedly a parody of some Zen proverb well known at the time, but it has not been possible to discover what. The word 'sairai', as well as being the Buddhist term for rebirth, could also mean a second visit to a courtesan by a favoured customer; and the ferry is more specifically a 'chokibune' ('boar's tusk' boat), which carried customers along the Sumida River to and from the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter.
